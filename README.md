PHP_LOGIN
=========

PHP Login taht I used to help me learn PHP, inspired by the PHP-Login project (which is amazing btw) here:

https://github.com/panique/php-login

In my quest to get better with PHP I wanted to learn the ropes and design/build a functional and secure Login using PHP. I started with researching and trying to find tutorials and found a whole bunch of ways to do things! The following sources were used and have helped me greatly in my learning PHP for this project:

http://webdevelopingcat.com/creating-a-registration-page-with-php-and-pdo/

Most importantly I followed this guide and wathced the videos from PHPacademy and they were great.

I would encourage anyone interested in learning PHP to check out their site it was very helpful and fun too!
